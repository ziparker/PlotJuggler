# How to build

First of all you need to clone the repository and its submodules either using the command:

      git clone --recursive https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler.git

or

      git clone https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler.git
      git submodule update --init --recursive


The only binary dependencies that you need installed on your system are Boost and Qt5. On Ubuntu the debans can be installed with the command:

    sudo apt-get -y install qtbase5-dev libboost-dev
    
The proceed as you would do with any cmake based project

     mkdir build; cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     sudo make install
 
 Note: you should not skip the last installation step. Currently the plugins need to be installed in the folder __/usr/local/lib/PlotJuggler/__ otherwise PlotJuggle will not find them.
 
# Note for ROS users
 
If you use CATKIN to build this project, the ROS related plugins will be automatically included into the compilation.
